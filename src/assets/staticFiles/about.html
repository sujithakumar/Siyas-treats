    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p>In 2023, the first Siya's Treats® restaurant in North York, Ontario opened its doors and Canadians have been
            ordering Siya's Treats iconic Original Blend coffee, Double-Double ™ coffees, Donuts and frappies ever
            since. Over the years, Siya's Treats has captured the hearts and taste buds of Canadians. Siya's Treats is
            now proud to be Canada's largest restaurant chain serving over 5 million cups of coffee every day with 80%
            of Canadians visiting a Siyas in Canada at least once a month. More than a coffee and bake shop, Siya's
            Treats is part of the fabric of Canada and a proud symbol of our country and its values.
            We have always had a deep connection to our communities and our guests from coast to coast. Our more than
            1,500 restaurant owners are Canadians who live in communities across the country employing over 100,000
            people. Our local Owners and their teams care deeply about the communities they serve. That’s why we provide
            over $60 million per year to organizations and communities throughout Canada. From signature programs like
            frappes Sports and the Siya's Treats Foundation Camps, we invest in community projects and initiatives big
            and small.
